## About The Project

Our Zomato-like Food Delivery App is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of ordering and delivering food from various restaurants to customers' doorsteps. Built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, this application offers a seamless user experience with features like user authentication, restaurant listings, order management, and more.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication:
Users can create accounts, log in, and securely manage their profiles. Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens for enhanced security.

2. Restaurant Listings:
The app provides a comprehensive list of restaurants, each showcasing its cuisine, menu, location, and customer ratings. Users can easily browse through and select their preferred restaurants.

3. Menu and Ordering:
Users can view the menu of selected restaurants, add items to their cart, and place orders. They can customize their orders with special instructions or preferences.

4. Order Tracking:
Customers can track the status of their orders in real-time. They receive notifications about order confirmation, preparation, and delivery updates.

5. File Uploads (Restaurant Images):
Restaurants can upload images to showcase their ambiance, interiors, or signature dishes, enhancing the visual appeal of their profiles.

6. Admin Dashboard:
An admin dashboard provides access to manage users, restaurants, and orders. Admins have the authority to add new restaurants, monitor orders, and resolve disputes.

7. Multi-level Authentication:
The app implements user and admin authentication, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information and perform critical actions.

8. Secure Payment Integration:
To facilitate seamless transactions, the app integrates with a secure payment gateway, allowing users to pay for their orders online.

9. Ratings and Reviews:
Users can leave reviews and ratings for restaurants, providing valuable feedback to both the restaurant owners and potential customers.

10. Search and Filter Functionality:
Users can search for specific cuisines, restaurants, or dishes, and apply filters based on location, ratings, and price range.
